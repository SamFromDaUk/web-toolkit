	<h1>Key structural elements</h1>

	<p>With the introduction of HTML5 and WAI-ARIA landmarks, you have to go all over the place to understand what the main layout structures should be. This page puts them all in one place. <strong>NB:</strong> this is valid as of May 2013, but worth checking the source materials (linked to below) after about September 2013!</p>

	<h2>HTML4 structural elements</h2>
	<p>These are built into HTML, already have good support from screen readers and other assistive technologies and are not made obsolete by HTML5:</p>

	<h3>Headings</h3>
	<p>Headings, levels 1-6 (<code>&lt;H1&gt;</code> - <code>&lt;H6&gt;</code>) are used to label content on the page, and screen readers use them to navigate within a  page. <br><strong>NB:</strong> HTML5 has defined a different way of dealing with headings, but the spec is not settled on that point and current technology still uses HTML4 style headings. <br>
	More on <a href="http://www.nomensa.com/blog/2010/using-html-headings/">using headings</a>.</p>

	<h3>Lists</h3>
	<p>Ordered (<code>ol</code>) and un-ordered (<code>ul</code>) lists are used to group things like navigation items and bulleted lists, providing a means of skipping over a list if needed. <br>
		More on <a href="http://www.nomensa.com/blog/2011/using-html-lists/">using lists</a>.</p>
	<h3>Tables</h3>
	<p>Tables should be used for tabular data, where the relationship between headings and cells matter. <br>
		More on <a href="http://www.nomensa.com/blog/2008/tables-more-than-just-rows-and-cells/">using tables</a>.</p>

	<h2 class="print-break">HTML5 structural elements</h2>

	<p>HTML5 introduces some new elements, some of which map to landmarks. However, support is not as good for those yet. Use them as per the HTML5 spec, but don't assume that assistive technology is doing anything with them yet.</p>

	<h3><a href="http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/grouping-content.html#the-main-element">Main</a></h3>
	<p><q>the main content of the body of a document or application. The main content area consists of content that is directly related to or expands upon the central topic of a document or central functionality of an application.</q></p>
	<p>The start of the <code>main</code> should be the same place a &quot;skip to content&quot; link would go, and there should only be one on the page. Other elements can be nested within a <code>main</code>.</p>
	
	<h3><a href="http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/sections.html#the-article-element">Article</a></h3>
	<p><q>a complete, or self-contained, composition in a document, page, application, or site and that is, in principle, independently distributable or reusable, e.g. in syndication. This could be a forum post, a magazine or newspaper article, a blog entry, a user-submitted comment, an interactive widget or gadget, or any other independent item of content.</q></p>
	<p>This could be used on news pages, or other areas with fairly standard blocks of content. You would use either <code>article</code> or <code>section</code>, not both. There can be more than one per page, but please don't over do it!</p>
	
	<h3><a href="http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/sections.html#the-aside-element">Aside</a></h3>
	<p><q>a section of a page that consists of content that is tangentially related to the content around the aside element, and which could be considered separate from that content. Such sections are often represented as sidebars in printed typography.</q></p>
	<p>This can be used for sidebars, but also for carousel elements at the top (it doesn't have to be to the side!). The key is that it could be considered independent from the main content.</p>
	
	<h3><a href="http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/sections.html#the-footer-element">Footer</a></h3>
	<p><q>a footer for its nearest ancestor sectioning content or sectioning root element. A footer typically contains information about its section such as who wrote it, links to related documents, copyright data, and the like.</q></p>
	<p>It is likely there is a page footer (where the footer is a direct child of the body), but there can be many footers on a page if there are many <code>article</code> / <code>section</code> / <code>aside</code> elements (sectioning elements).</p>
	
	<h3><a href="http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/sections.html#the-header-element">Header</a></h3>
	<p><q>introductory content for its nearest ancestor sectioning content or sectioning root element. A header typically contains a group of introductory or navigational aids.</q></p>
	<p>This can apply to the whole page (which can be used with <code>banner</code>, below), or it can apply to a specific area of the page such as the top of a section or article.</p>

	<h3><a href="http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/sections.html#the-nav-element">Nav</a></h3>
	<p><q>a section of a page that links to other pages or to parts within the page: a section with navigation links.</q></p>
	<p>The main and secondary navigation elements on a page should use <code>nav</code>, but landing pages or galleries (pages which list many links) should not mark every link-list as <code>nav</code>. If there is more than one on a page, you should label each (see below).</p>
	
	<h3><a href="http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/sections.html#the-section-element">Section</a></h3>
	<p><q>a generic section of a document or application. A section, in this context, is a thematic grouping of content, typically with a heading.</q></p>
	<p>Please note that a <code>section</code> != <code>div</code>! I'm not entirely sure what impact it is supposed to have on assistive technology, but at the moment Jaws will announce a section every time you navigate to one.</p>


	<h2 class="print-break">ARIA landmark roles</h2>

	<p>The Accessible Rich Internet Application specification (<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/roles#landmark_roles">ARIA landmarks spec</a>) has a section dedicated to landmarks, attributes that you apply to HTML elements. For example:</p>
	<pre><code>&lt;form action=&quot;/search&quot; method=&quot;post&quot; <strong>role=&quot;search&quot;</strong>&gt;</code></pre>

	<p>These provide extra <q>hooks</q> for assistive technology to use in navigating pages and applications. Current support is good in some screen readers (e.g. recent versions of Jaws, NVDA and VoiceOver). However, keyboard users have no main-stream way of accessing them yet.</p>

	<figure>
		<img class="bordered" src="../assets/images/resources-aria-landmarks.png" alt="Example layout showing the various landmarks such as banner, navigation, main, complementary, and contentinfo.">
		<figcaption>An example layout with ARIA roles included.</figcaption>
	</figure>

	<p>Where ARIA-landmarks overlap with HTML5 elements, both should be used on the same element. e.g. </p>
	<pre><code>&lt;main role=&quot;main&quot;&gt;</code></pre>

	<h3>Banner</h3>
	<p><q>A region that contains mostly site-oriented content, rather than page-specific content.</q>  Typically you would apply this to the top area of each page that includes the logo &amp; site search.</p>
	<p>You would generally only have one <code>banner</code> at the top of each page.</p>
	<h3>Main</h3>
	<p><q>The main content of a document.</q></p>
	<p> Generally this would be the target of the 'skip to content' link. You must only have one <code>main</code>.</p>
	<h3>Complementatary</h3>
	<p><q>A supporting section of the document, designed to be complementary to the main content at a similar level in the DOM hierarchy, but remains meaningful when separated from the main content.</q></p>
	<p>Often used for sidebars.</p>
	<h3>Contentinfo</h3>
	<p><q>A large perceivable region that contains information about the parent document. Examples of information included in this region of the page are copyrights and links to privacy statements.</q> </p>
	<p>Basically this is for the footer.</p>
	<h3>Navigation</h3>
	<p><q>A collection of navigational elements (usually links) for navigating the document or related documents.</q></p>
	<p>There can be more than one <code>navigation</code>.</p>
	<h3>Search</h3>
	<p><q>A landmark region that contains a collection of items and objects that, as a whole, combine to create a search facility.</q></p>
	<p>Note that the search role should be applied at the form level, not just the input.</p>
	

	<p>There is a <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/roles#role_definitions">complete list</a> in the specification, but please make sure you know what impact the other ones have before using them.</p>

	<h2 class="print-break">Labelling landmarks</h2>
	<p>For the landmarks which can be used more than once on a page, it can help to label them.</p> 

	<p>For example, if you had this navigation element:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;nav <strong>role=&quot;navigation&quot;</strong>&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create your perfect Sky bundle:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;fresh.html&quot;&gt;TV &amp; Boxes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;dairy.html&quot;&gt;Broadband &amp; Talk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&hellip;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/nav&gt;</code></pre>

		<p>You could provide a label for that navigation:</p>

		<pre><code>&lt;nav role=&quot;navigation&quot; <strong>aria-labelledby=&quot;firstLabel&quot;</strong>&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create your perfect 
	<strong>&lt;span id=&quot;firstLabel&quot;&gt;Sky bundle&lt;/span&gt;</strong>:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;fresh.html&quot;&gt;TV &amp; Boxes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;dairy.html&quot;&gt;Broadband &amp; Talk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&hellip;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/nav&gt;</code></pre>

<p>Screen readers can then announce it as <q>Sky bundle, navigation</q>.</p>
