<h1>Managing accessible projects</h1>
<p>The most effective way to meet accessibility goals is to build accessibility in from the project outset. This section explains how to plan for accessibility, and takes you through the key steps for success.</p>
<p>All the best practice advice provided by Nomensa aims to ensure that web accessibility is enhanced, but does not compromise the overall project goals.</p>

<h2>Before the project</h2>
<p>Before the project begins, there are several things you can do to make your accessibility goals more achievable.</p>
<h3>Prepare for accessibility</h3>
<p>If your project team has good accessibility knowledge, there may be little you need to do to prepare. If they are less experienced or if this is the first project where accessibility has been introduced, the following steps will help:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Provide accessibility training from a reputable organisation, to give your team a basic grounding;</li>
	<li>Make this best practice accessibility kit required reading for practitioners, to establish a baseline for accessibility throughout the project;</li>
	<li>Consider working with a specialist agency, to accelerate the transfer of knowledge into your team and provide support along the way.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Choosing technologies</h3>
<p>There are certain types of content that require more attention (and sometimes more cost) to meet accessibility goals. It's important to be aware of these choices as early as possible so you can factor any additional time or resources into your project. Typical examples include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Flash movies;</li>
	<li>PDF downloads;</li>
	<li>Multimedia content;</li>
	<li>JavaScript functionality.</li>
</ul>

<p>In general Sky avoid Flash and PDF, but make use of video and JavaScript functionality, so the <a href="../guidelines/index.html">guidelines</a> section of this toolkit focus on those aspects.</p>

<h2>During a project</h2>
<aside><img class="right" src="../assets/images/managing-01-cycle.png" alt=""></aside>
<p>Web development projects usually break down into a series of stages. The exact process varies, but generally each stage results in a set of deliverables such as wireframes, designs or HTML code.</p>
<p>The practitioners responsible for each stage of the project should build accessibility into every deliverable. You should also plan regular accessibility reviews during each stage of the project, allowing time for changes to be made.</p>
<p>Approaching it in this way is more agile and more cost effective than leaving it until the end. The following sections describe each of the key accessibility review points you should consider.</p>
<h3>Brand guidelines</h3>
<p>Brand guidelines describe the fonts, colours, and tone of voice that will be applied to the website. Colour contrast, readable fonts, and clear language are all important accessibility factors.</p>
<figure>
	<img src="../assets/images/managing-02-text-size.png" alt="">
	<figcaption>Figure 1: Some styles are not suitable for the web.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Sky's brand guidelines do not generally cause  accessibility issues, but any changes in future should be checked to ensure issues are not being built in at the start. Maintaining brand integrity is extremely important, and if a team varies from the main brand it should be checked for accessibility.</p>

<h3>Early stages: Information Architecture (IA), sketches and wireframes</h3>
<p>The IA and wireframes describe the navigation and layout of individual pages. Relevant accessibility factors at this stage include consistency of page layout, page structure, and clear link text.</p>
<figure>
	<img src="../assets/images/managing-03-wireframes.png" alt="">
	<figcaption>Figure 2: Low fidelity wireframes are quick and easy to adjust.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The IA and wireframes are relatively low fidelity and can be adjusted quickly and easily. Getting accessibility right at this stage puts a robust foundation in place as the creative designs are applied.</p>

<h3>Visual designs</h3>
<p>The designs add colour and texture to the website, generally based on the brand guidelines. Colour remains an important accessibility factor, along with readability, link and error styling.</p>

<figure>
	<img src="../assets/images/managing-04-contrast.png" alt="">
	<figcaption>Figure 3: Colour contrast can make a big difference to readability.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>High fidelity designs introduce fine detail into the project for the first time. An accessibility review at this stage is therefore the last opportunity to resolve any design related accessibility problems before coding begins.</p>

<h3>Development / Implementation</h3>
<p>Turning designs into code is a key stage, more accessibility issues can be created or solved here than at any other time including text alternatives, keyboard accessibility, and well structured content.</p>
<p>Having a template stage (after design but before implementation) can help ensure a clean start. Having HTML/CSS/JavaScript templates means you can assess them from an accessibilty (and code quality) point of view before integrating with a Content Management System (CMS) or other environment.</p>
<figure class="right">
	<img src="../assets/images/code-quality.png" class="bordered" alt="Screenshot of some HTML code, all in one giant block and looking quite messy.">
	<figcaption>For people developing applictaions, the quality of the HTML is often low on the priority list.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Someone creating front-end code needs to consider things like HTML structure, CSS compatibility, and they are primarily coding for the browsers. An application developer has to consider whether the functionality works, and they are primarily coding for the application environment (e.g. Java, PHP.)</p>
<p>If templates are created from the designs, they can be checked before being implemented into a content management system or application. They'll form the basis of every page of the website.</p>

<figure>
	<img src="../assets/images/managing-05-code.png" alt="Screenshot of the W3C HTML validator.">
	<figcaption>Figure 4: Template development should conform to web standards.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The majority of accessibility best practice is dependent on the HTML code of the website. Reviewing templates at this stage will give you an opportunity to make positive adjustments to the core code, before the templates are integrated into a CMS or application.</p>

<h3>Template integration</h3>
<p>Template integration is the process of migrating HTML templates into the CMS or application. Very few CMSs offer good native support for accessibility, so the process of template integration can inadvertently introduce accessibility complications.</p>
<p>Reviewing the templates again after integration is optional, but bear in mind that any accessibility problem introduced at this stage will occur every time that template is used to create a page on the website.</p>

<h3>Content loading</h3>
<p>Loading content into the new website is usually the last part of the web development process. Since this is what the majority of visitors to the site will be looking for it is important to ensure accessibility is carefully considered. Information structure, clear language, and clear link text are all important accessibility factors at this stage.</p>
<p>This will be the final review point before the website (or updated section) goes live. A review at this stage will give you confidence that you've met your accessibility goals in time for launch.</p>


<h2>After the project</h2>
<p>Once the project is complete and the website is live, you'll need to put in place plans to maintain accessibility levels.</p>

<h3>Accessibility monitoring</h3>
<p>Putting in place a programme of regular accessibility reviews will help you maintain the accessibility level. Regular feedback will mean you can move quickly and effectively to resolve any problems that are identified. The frequency of reviews should depend on how rapidly content is added to the website. The following table contains guidance for selecting the frequency of accessibility reviews.</p>
<table>
	<thead>
		<tr>
		<th>
			New pages/month
		</th>
		<th>
			Review frequency
		</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
		<td>
			0 to 50 pages
		</td>
		<td>
			Bi-annually
		</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		<td>
			50 to 250 pages
		</td>
		<td>
		Quarterly
		</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		<td>
			250 to 1000 pages
		</td>
		<td>
			Bi-monthly
		</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		<td>
			1000 to 5000 pages
		</td>
		<td>
			Monthly
		</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<p>The general principle is that the more new (and different) things go up on a site, the more it needs to be tested. If exactly the same type of content is added on an infrequent basis, the less it needs testing.</p>

<h3>New developments</h3>
<p>If you plan to introduce new content or functionality to the website, the process is the same as for the original project. The difference is that the review points are scoped to fit the smaller area under development.</p>
<h2>Final thoughts</h2>
<p>Planning is the key to meeting accessibility goals. Making accessibility part of the &quot;business as usual&quot; takes some preparation, but the result is a solid foundation of knowledge within the team that will benefit all future projects. Building accessibility review points into the project plan, and planning regular monitoring points once the website goes live, will help you meet and maintain the accessibility goals in the most cost effective way.</p>
