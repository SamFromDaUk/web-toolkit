	<h1>HTML &amp; CSS - Guidelines</h1>
		
	<p>Translating  designs into code for the first time is a critical step in any web project. This page explains how to make HTML/CSS code accessible, and ensure that every page of Sky's website is based on a standards compliant and accessible template.</p>
	
	<p>The following WCAG 2.0 success criteria should be considered when developing the templates for Sky's website.</p>

	<h2 id="correct-markup">Using the correct markup</h2>
	<blockquote class="levelA">
		<p>1.3.1 Information and Relationships: Information, structure, and relationships conveyed through presentation can be programmatically determined or are available in text.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>Every single element defined within the HTML specification has a purpose.  As such, the elements that you choose to make use of impart a certain amount of information about that element and its relationship to other elements on the page. This information is used by browsers and assistive technologies such as screen readers to convey information on the page to people. </p>
	<p>For example, browsers will automatically allow links marked up using the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element to receive focus using a keyboard.  If a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element had been used instead a person using a keyboard would not be able to move focus to it.  This is becoming more of a problem since developers have been able to repurpose standard HTML elements to behave like links using JavaScript.</p>
	<p>Many assistive technologies such as screen readers rely on well written HTML code for streamlined navigation.  For example, a person using a screen reader will be able to skip from one heading to another using a shortcut key.  This is extremely useful since it allows people who use screen reading software to get an idea of the pages structure easily.  However, the screen reader will only consider an element a 'heading' if it has been marked up using an HTML heading element (<code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> through to <code>&lt;h6&gt;</code>).</p>

	<figure>
		<img src="../assets/images/html-01.png" alt="A webpage showing the heading structure and nesting.">
		<figcaption>Figure 1: Use nested heading to separate and structure content.</figcaption>
	</figure>

	<p>On the other hand, if more generic elements are used and styled to look like headings using CSS, assistive technologies such as screen readers are not likely to identify them as headings.  This can make it significantly harder for people who use screen readers to navigate the content.</p>
	<p>In addition to this, using HTML elements for their intended purpose has many benefits for accessibility.  Consider a form input with a text label.  If the text label is marked-up using the <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> element, instead of the <code>&lt;label&gt;</code> element, it can not be associated with the form field to which it belongs.  For sighted people the location of the text label near to the form field should be sufficient to identify the purpose of the field.</p>

	<figure>
		<img src="../assets/images/html-02.png" alt="A typical form with labels positioned correctly for inputs with a submit button.">
		<figcaption>Figure 2: Use labels for form elements and associate them  correctly.</figcaption>
	</figure>

	<p>However, for people who use assistive technologies such as screen readers the relationship between form field and label is likely to be much harder to establish.  If the HTML <code>&lt;label&gt;</code> element had been used instead of a <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> element this issue would be much easier to rectify.  The <code>&lt;label&gt;</code> element has an attribute that makes it possible to provide an explicit relationship between a form field and its text label.  The 'for' attribute of the <code>&lt;label&gt;</code> must have the same value as the 'id' attribute of the associated form field. Ensuring the 'for' and 'id' values are the same will create the relationship between the text label and the form field.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;label for="q"&gt;Search&lt;/label&gt;</code>
<code>&lt;input id="q" name="search" type="text" /&gt;</code></pre>

	<p>If a form field is correctly associated with a label, when a person using a screen reader moves focus to the form field, the software will automatically find and read out the label.  This makes it much easier for people using assistive technologies such as screen readers to identify the purpose of a form field.  In addition to this a correctly marked up label acts as an extended "hit area".  If the label is clicked focus will be moved to the corresponding form field automatically.  This is extremely beneficial for people with poor hand to eye coordination such as those with motor neuron diseases.</p>

	<h3 id="aria">Using ARIA landmark roles</h3>

	<p>The WAI-ARIA spcification (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) aims to bridge the gap between modern websites (with more interactivity) and what elements HTML provides. For example, a sighted person will be able to quickly glance at a page and identify the main regions within itsuch as the main navigation, sidebars, header, footer and main content.  However, people who use assistive technologies such as screen readers are likely to find it significantly harder to identify these regions.</p>
	<p>One part of ARIA that is safe to use in static HTML is identifying regions of content within HTML documents, to tag them with information about specific roles in relation to the rest of the page.  For example, the main navigation on the site can be tagged so that information about its purpose is conveyed to people who use assistive technologies such as screen readers.  This is achieved using the role attribute:</p> 
<pre><code>&lt;nav <strong>role="navigation"</strong>&gt;  
	&lt;ul&gt;    
		&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#"&gt;Link 1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#"&gt;Link 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#"&gt;Link 3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>

	<p>Other ARIA landmark roles suitable for many websites include:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>banner</li>
		<li>complimentary</li>
		<li>contentinfo</li>
		<li>form</li>
		<li>main</li>
		<li>search</li>
	</ul>
	<p>See the page <a href="../resources/structural-elements.html">Key HTML elements &amp; ARIA landmarks list</a> which provides a list of the all the useful structural markup and when to use them.</p>

	<h2>Creating a meaningful reading order</h2>
	<blockquote class="levelA">
		<p>1.3.2 Meaningful Sequence: When the sequence in which content is presented affects its meaning, a correct reading sequence can be programmatically determined.</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>Structuring pages correctly is a very important part of creating an accessible website. The order in which content appears  needs to be considered from the very beginning of the web development process. The content should be displayed in an order which allows the information presented to make sense when read through from top to bottom. While this sounds like a common sense approach, it's surprising how many web developers get this wrong.</p>
	<p>Some techniques for coding web pages allow content to be presented visually in an order which is different from the underlying code order. For people using screen reading software which reads the content of the page aloud, it is important the underlying source order makes sense and has not been altered to create the visual presentation of the page.</p>

	<figure>
		<img src="../assets/images/html-06.png" alt="Screenshot showing content that is visibly in columns but actually in rows in the code.">
		<figcaption>Figure 3: The Choose your Sky box section with the under-lying structure showing.</figcaption>
	</figure>

	<p>Creating columns such as those in Figure 3 as rows means that assistive techology will read the content across rather than down, making it very difficult to understand.</p>

	<p>It is important for web developers to think about the underlying code order of the page before concentrating on the visual appearance. Undoubtedly the visual appearance will have some impact on the code order, however it is essential to get the code order correct first and worry about the visuals later.</p>
	<p>Imagine a page containing information about web accessibility and web design. Visually the information has been split into two columns, with web accessibility information in the left column and web design information in the right column.</p>
	<p>To a sighted person this content can be easily understood. However to someone who can't see the page (who may be listening to the content instead) it may not be quite so easy to understand. Looking at the underlying code order, we can see the information is grouped together without any structure or thought given to the order in which the content is presented.</p>


<pre class="badexample"><code>&lt;div class="box"&gt;     
   &lt;span class="menu1"&gt;Web Accessibility&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="menu2"&gt;Web Design&lt;/span&gt;      
   &lt;span class="item1"&gt;Accessibility Audits&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="item2"&gt;User experience design&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="item3"&gt;Accessible PDFs&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="item4"&gt;Template Development&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="item5"&gt;Accessibility Guardianship&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="item6"&gt;Defacto CMS&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>

	<p>Original example from the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2010/NOTE-WCAG20-TECHS-20101014/F1.html">W3C's WCAG 2.0 technical note F1</a></p>
	<p>Someone using a screen reader or other types of assistive technology may have difficulty understanding what the purpose of this content is. In order to correct this problem, the content must be ordered correctly:</p>
<pre>Web Accessibility
Accessibility Audits
Accessible PDFs
Accessibility Guardianship
Web Design
User experience design
Template development
Defacto CMS</pre>

	<p>Once the content is in the right order, each item can be marked-up using the appropriate HTML elements. The titles 'Web Accessibility' and 'Web Design' are marked up as headings, while the lists of services are marked up using unordered lists.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;h2&gt;Web Accessibility&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;Accessibility Audits&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;Accessible PDFs&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;Accessible Media Player&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Web Design&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;User experience Design&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;Template Development&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;Defacto CMS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</code></pre>


	<p>While this may be an extreme example, it helps to highlight how important it is to think about the underlying order of the content on each page.</p>

	<h2 id="text-resizing">Ensure text is resizable</h2>
	<blockquote class="levelAA">
		<p>1.4.4 Resize text: Except for captions and images of text, text can be resized without assistive technology up to 200 percent without loss of content or functionality.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>As a web developer, it's important to make sure that pages are flexible in terms of layout and text size. Not everyone views websites in the same way.  People will be viewing the website on a number of devices such as desktop computers, laptops, netbooks, smart phones, tablets and televisions. These devices may have different resolutions as well as different orientations. With so many different options to keep in mind it is vital that the website can adapt to display its content in the most appropriate manner for the particular device.</p>
	<p>Not only will the layout need to adapt, you'll also have to ensure the elements within the page are flexible to render the content with a variety of different text sizes. People with mild visual impairments may need to increase the size of things in their browser to read the content on the webpage more easily. If this happens, the containers holding content as well as the content itself should either increase or decrease in size without obscuring any of the content or restricting the functionality of the page.</p>
	
	<p>Sky is taking a responsive-design approach which helps to fulfil this criteria.</p>

	<h3>Desktop browser resizing methods</h3>
	<p>The traditional way to resize websites was by increasing the text size, the main issues then were caused by fixed-height containers where the text would 'explode' out of them.</p> 

	<figure>
		<img class="bordered" src="../assets/images/layouts-01.png" alt="Sky homepage with the text size increased, causing it to overlap in several areas.">
		<figcaption>Figure 4: Increasing text-size used to be the standard method, but now zoom is the default.</figcaption>
	</figure>

	<p>Thankfully browsers have all moved to 'zoom' as the default method of making things bigger, which increases text, images and layout. That means it can be dealt with using media queries as part of a responsive design. It is still possible to set some browsers to increase text-size without zooming; however, if the site allows for zooming, that fulfils the criteria <em>and</em> provides the best experience for the most common resizing method.</p>

	<figure>
		<img class="bordered" src="../assets/images/layouts-02.png" alt="Sky homepage zoomed in, showing a single column view of the same content.">
		<figcaption>Figure 5: Zooming in (should) trigger the mobile/responsive view of the site.</figcaption>
	</figure>
	
	<p><strong>NB:</strong> There is a bug in Chrome and Safari (Webkit) where zooming does not trigger media queries specified in pixels. However, this bug was fixed in early 2013 and zooming should trigger media queries in Safari and Chrome soon.</p>

	<h3>CSS units</h3>

	<p>There is mixed advice on which units are most suitable for layout, but these days it is quite simple. There are (at least) 13 different units defined in CSS but they break down to two types.</p>
	<dl>
		<dt>Content units</dt>
		<dd><code>px, in, cm, mm, em, rem, pt, pc, ex, ch</code></dd>
		<dd>These units are relative to the content, and all of them are translated by browsers to CSS-pixels. Zooming in essentially increases the size of a pixel, so all elements get bigger.</dd>
		<dt>Viewport units</dt>
		<dd><code>%, vh, vw</code></dd>
		<dd>These are calculated relative to the browser's <em>document</em> viewport. Zooming in does not change how these units are displayed. For example, 50% of the document width remains 50% when zoomed in.</dd>
	</dl>

	<p>The key thing to remember is that elements defined in content units expand as you zoom in, but the viewport units do not change. Therefore if you define one column in pixels units and another in percentages, they will overlap when you zoom in.</p>

	<p>Most designs will use a combination of content and viewport units, which is fine, you just need to be aware of what happens when users zoom in and test new layouts thoroughly.</p>

	<h3>Mobile browser zoom</h3>

	<p>Mobile browsers deal with zoom differently: Instead of making elements on the page bigger, mobile browsers act like a screen magnifier and only show part of the page.</p>

	<figure>
		<img class="bordered" src="../assets/images/layouts-03.png" alt="A screenshot of a web page with a phone placed over the top. The phone shows the visual viewport, the whole screenshot is the document viewport.">
		<figcaption>Figure 6: The document stays the same width, but your view shows only part of it.</figcaption>
	</figure>

	<p>Mobile browsers tend not to provide extra zooming features for people with visual impairments, so it is important not to prevent the normal zooming action <em>even for responsive designs</em>.</p>
	<p>For example, when using the meta-viewport for responsive design, do not include a <code>maximum-scale</code> of less than 2, otherwise people cannot zoom in to 200%.</p>

	<pre class="goodexample"><code>&lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot; content=&quot;width=device-width, 
initial-scale=1,<strong>maximum-scale=2</strong>&quot;&gt;</code></pre>

	<h2 id="keyboard-support">Provide support for keyboard devices</h2>
	<blockquote class="levelA">
		<p>2.1.1 Keyboard: All functionality of the content is operable through a keyboard interface without requiring specific timings for individual keystrokes, except where the underlying function requires input that depends on the path of the user's movement and not just the endpoints.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>As a web developer it is important to bear in mind that many people use a keyboard to navigate websites as opposed to a mouse.  People who use a keyboard to navigate will only be able to activate links and controls that have been coded using elements intended for that purpose.</p>
	<p>For example, an element that has been marked-up as a &lt;div&gt; will not be recognised by a keyboard as an interactive element.  On the other hand, links (<code>&lt;a&gt;</code>), buttons (<code>&lt;button&gt;</code>) and form elements (<code>&lt;input&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;textarea&gt;</code>) will be recognised and can therefore be activated using keyboard commands.</p>

	<p>It is becoming increasingly common for developers to use HTML elements coupled with JavaScript to replicate the behaviour of links and form controls. For people who use a mouse this is unlikely to cause any immediate issues.  However, this is far from the case for people who use a keyboard for interacting with a web page.  If a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element combined with JavaScript was used instead of a link, a person using a keyboard would not be able to interact with it since it would not be recognised as an interactive element on the page.</p>
	<p>It is essential that the correct HTML elements are used for their intended purpose in order for pages to function as expected when used by people using keyboards or keyboard emulators.  It is essential to test each component or piece of functionality thoroughly with a keyboard alone to iron out problems with any keyboard related accessibility issues.</p>
	<p>Even when using modern markup such as WAI-ARIA, be sure to keep in mind this approach as rectifying these types of issues further down the line can be both time consuming and costly. The <a href="http://sky-toolkit.nomensa.com/assets/images/examples-tabs.html">tabs example</a> page shows how to combine WAI-ARIA code whilst using standard markup.</p>

	<h2 id="skip-links">Provide skip links for repetitive content</h2>
	<blockquote class="levelA">
		<p>2.4.1 Bypass blocks: A mechanism is available to bypass blocks of content that are repeated on multiple Web pages.</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>Different people use different mechanisms for interacting with their computers and the Internet.  For people who cannot see or have poor co-ordination it can be hard, if not impossible, to use a mouse effectively.  For this reason, many people choose to use a keyboard rather than a mouse.  This has a fundamental impact on the way in which people use their computers and as such has as much of an impact on the way that people use the web.</p>

	<figure>
		<img class="bordered" src="../assets/images/html-07.png" alt="Screen show of a carousel with filters.">
		<figcaption>Figure 7: Keyboard users currently have to tab through the hundreds of logos before getting to the controls.</figcaption>
	</figure>

	<p>There are other issues with the carousel above (e.g. improving the keyboard controls), but at the least providing a skip link above the carousel would enable keyboard users to bypass that area.</p>

	<p>People who navigate using a keyboard generally read web pages sequentially from top to bottom. This is because rather than pointing at elements on the page and clicking with a mouse, they will move through the page one element at a time using the tab or arrow keys.  If large blocks of content such as long lists of links (e.g. a main menu) are repeated on each page it can be extremely frustrating having to tab or arrow through these lists before reaching the main content. People with more severe physical disabilities, such as quadriplegia, will often use assistive devices such as head or mouth wands to press keys on the keyboard. For these people pressing keys to move pass repetitive blocks of content can be tiring at best and physically exhausting at worst.</p>

	<p>One of the techniques used to assist people with this issue is the use of internal page navigation often known as 'skip links'. A skip link will direct people to a different section of the same page.  For example, many sites include a link at the top of the page which moves the keyboard focus to the main content region when it is activated.  This means that people who use a keyboard for navigation will be able to bypass any elements that appear at the start of the page gaining easier access to the information that they are looking for.  A skip link can be implemented much like any other link on a web page.  The only difference is that the 'href' attribute of the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag should reference the '<code>id</code>' of the target element/region on the page prefixed with the '<code>#</code>' character:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a href="#content"&gt;Skip to content&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div id="navigation"&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    ... Links go here...
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="content"&gt;
  ... Content goes here...
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>

	<p>For people who use assistive technologies such as screen readers a number of other methods can be used to browse web pages.  For example, a person using a screen reader will be able to skip through the page by moving between headings (normally by using the 'h' key).  This allows people who use screen readers to get an idea of the structure of the page and makes it easier for them to access specific sections of the document with ease.  The screen reader software interacts directly with the source of the page, and as such can only identify headings on the page if HTML heading elements are used.  If headings are marked up using some other HTML elements and styled to look like headings using CSS, screen reader software will not identify them as headings.  As a result this will inhibit the person's ability to skip through the page on a heading by heading basis.</p>
	<p>Instead of:</p>
	<div class="badexample">
		<p><strong>HTML:</strong>  <code>&lt;span class="myheading"&gt;Introduction&lt;/span&gt;</code></p>
		<p><strong>CSS:</strong>  <code>.myheading{font-size:2em;}</code></p>
	</div>
	<p>Use:</p>
	<div class="goodexample">
		<p><strong>HTML:</strong>  <code>&lt;h2&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;</code></p>
		<p><strong>CSS:</strong>  <code>h2{font-size:2em;}</code></p>
	</div>

	<p>Headings should be used to identify discrete regions and sections of a page and as such should always cascade down the page from one level to the next.  For example, there should always be only one master heading on any given page.  This should identify the primary content on the page and should be fairly concise.  Following on from this, level 2 headings should be used to identify regions of the page such as content, navigation and sidebars. Level 2 headings should be followed by level 3 headings, level 3 headings followed by level 4 headings and so forth.</p>
	<p>Ensuring that links are marked up as lists (where there are at least three links within any one group) will also make pages easier to navigate for people who use assistive technologies such as screen readers.  When a person using a screen reader encounters a list the software will announce the presence of the list and the number of items within it.  The person using the screen reader can then decide to either browse through the list, or to bypass it entirely.  This can make it easier for people to bypass blocks of links that they have no interest in.</p>

	<h2>Use descriptive page titles</h2>
	<blockquote class="levelA">
	<p>2.4.2 Page titles: Web pages have titles that describe topic or purpose.</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>Every page of Sky's website should have a unique title which summarises the content found on that page. The page title is located at the top of the browser window and for browsers which support tabs, often repeated in the tab for each page displayed.</p>

	<figure>
		<img src="../assets/images/html-03.png" alt="A page is shown with the page title highlighted in the browser bar and tab.">
		<figcaption>Figure 8: Describe the page accurately using the title element.</figcaption>
	</figure>

	<p>Page titles play an important part in helping people understand where they are within the website. As the page title is located in the &lt;head&gt; of the page, it is one of the first things that is encountered when the page loads. This helps people with certain cognitive disabilities understand which page they are on in the website as well as the pages location within the website. It also helps people decide if the content on the page is relevant to them. If it isn't they can navigate away from the page without having to wade through all the content to see if it is appropriate.</p>
	<p>Page titles should be short and concise helping people to scan them easily or listen to them quickly. Ideally page titles should contain the name of the page, the top level section the page is within and the name of the website, in the following format:</p>
	<p>Name of page - Section - Name of the website</p>
	<p>Some people argue over whether to put the name of the website as the first item in the page title or the name of the page. The most important information should be placed first in the page title as this is the first piece of content people will digest when reading or listening to the page title. If the name of the website is first in the title, people have to read or listen to the whole title before understanding which page they are viewing. Front loading the unique information in the title speeds up this orientation process, helping people to find information on the page that little bit quicker.</p>
	<p>As a developer, you may be responsible for making sure the page titles are output in the correct format. If you are using a content management system, this usually requires setting up the format for page titles in the base templates for the website.</p>
	<p>Both the name of the page and the section of the site should be created automatically. The name of the page will be the value entered by the content editors when creating pages for the website. The section the page lives within should be pulled automatically from the website hierarchy depending on where the content editor places their page. Depending on the content management system used, the name of the site may need to be manually entered into the templates, or if you are using a system such as WordPress or Drupal, the name of the site can be pulled from the main settings entered when setting up the website.</p>

	<h2 id="visible-focus-order">Visible focus order of content</h2>
	<blockquote class="levelA">
		<p>2.4.3 Focus Order: If a Web page can be navigated sequentially and the navigation sequences affect meaning or operation, focusable components receive focus in an order that preserves meaning and operability.</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>For people who navigate web pages using a keyboard the order in which interactive elements appear in the page can have a significant effect on the usability and accessibility of the page.  When people move the keyboard focus from one element to another using the tab key they generally expect the content to be presented in a logical order.  </p>
	<p>People using keyboards often move through a web page in a top to bottom, left to right fashion, moving through content in a predictable and logical manner. This helps them to understand where the keyboard focus is on the page, understand the relationships between items of content on the page and which elements they can interact with. If content is not presented in a logical order it is harder to identify where the keyboard focus is on the page and interact with the page content.</p>

	<h2 id="visible-focus-indicator">Visible focus indicators</h2>
	<blockquote>
	<p>2.4.7 Focus Visible: Any keyboard operable user interface has a mode of operation where the keyboard focus indicator is visible.</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>For sighted people who use a keyboard for navigation, being able to identify which element can be activated any given time is an important factor for accessibility.  By default, many browsers provide a thin black dotted line around the element that has keyboard focus.</p>
	
	<figure>
		<img src="../assets/images/html-04.png" alt="An example of the default keyboard focus indicator (dotted line around links).">
		<figcaption>Figure 9: The default focus indicator.</figcaption>
	</figure>

	<p>Although this is a good start, the thin black dotted line can be quite hard for people to see in certain circumstances.  As such it is good practice to enhance the display of the focus indicator using CSS.  This can be achieved using the CSS: focus pseudo class.  Using this class, we can easily highlight each element when it gains keyboard focus.  This can be done by inverting the foreground and background colours of an element when it gains focus.  This makes the element with focus immediately identifiable on the page as it visually stands out from the other links and interactive elements on the page.</p>
	<p><strong>HTML:</strong> <code>&lt;a href="path/to/page.html"&gt;My link&lt;/a&gt;</code></p>
	<p><strong>CSS:</strong> </p>

<pre><code>a, a:link{
 color:#000;
  background-color:#FFF;}
a:focus{
  color:#FFF;
  background-color:#000;}</code></pre>

	<p>Often web developers will remove the default focus indicator (thin black dotted line) because it doesn't fit with the look and feel of the page.  This is generally considered bad practice, because it can make it extremely difficult for people using keyboards to navigate easily around the page. If you do decide to remove the default focus indicator using CSS, make sure that you replace it with other appropriate styles using the techniques suggested above.</p>

	<h2 id="human-language">Identify the human language of the whole page</h2>
	<blockquote class="levelA">
	<p>3.1.1 Language of page: The default human language of each Web page can be programmatically determined.</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>The content of the website may be written in one language or it may be written in a number of different languages. No matter what language is used, it is important to make sure the primary language of the website is identified in the code. Identifying the primary language of the page doesn't mean identifying which computer language (PHP, Python or Java) you are using. Instead it means identifying which language the content is written in such as English, Russian or Arabic. If the correct language is identified in the code people using screen readers and other types of assistive technologies are automatically presented with information using the correct accent and pronunciation for the language.</p>

	<p>The primary language of a page is the language the majority of the content is written in. For example if a page is predominantly written in English then the primary language should be set as English.</p>
	<p>Once the primary language of the pages has been chosen, you will need to find the language code which corresponds to that language. Language codes usually consist of two letters, however four letter codes can be used for further defining the language into different dialects. A two letter language code 'en' could be used to define 'English', whereas the four letter language code 'en-GB' could be used to distinguish British English from American English 'en-US'. Please note 'en-UK' is not a valid four letter language code.</p>
	<p>The language code needs to be applied to each page of the website. To set the primary language as English you can use the 'lang' attribute along with the 'en' language code and apply this to the HTML element at the beginning of each page. For other language codes use the <a href="http://people.w3.org/rishida/utils/subtags/index.php">Language SubTag Lookup Tool</a>.</p>
	<p>For HTML5:</p>
	<pre><code>&lt;html lang="en"&gt;</code></pre>

	<h2>Identify the human language of parts of the page</h2>
	<blockquote class="levelA">
	<p>3.1.2 Language of parts: The human language of each passage or phrase in the content can be programmatically determined except for proper names, technical terms, words of indeterminate language, and words or phrases that have become part of the vernacular of the immediately surrounding text.</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>If a web page is written in a number of different human languages each section of content that is written in a language other than the default language used should be identified using the 'lang' attribute.  Consider a page written primarily in English.  The default language should be declared using the 'lang' attribute on the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element.  If a smaller section of this page were written in French, this section would also need to be identified by the same means.  However, instead of applying the 'lang' attribute to the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element, it should be applied to the container that the French text resides in.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    ...
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;div id="content"&gt;
       &lt;p&gt;Everything in this section should be written in English&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div id="sidebar" lang="fr"&gt;
       &lt;p&gt;Tout dans ce r&eacute;cipient doit &ecirc;tre r&eacute;dig&eacute; en fran&ccedil;ais&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>

	<p>If a link on a web page points to a page written in a different language the link should be given an attribute that identifies the language of the destination page.  This is the '<code>href-lang</code>' attribute which can be given a 2 or 4 character language code in the same manner as the '<code>lang</code>' attribute.  However, the '<code>href-lang</code>' attribute should be used to identify the default human language of the destination page as opposed to the language of the current page:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a href="path/to/French/page.html" href-lang="fr"&gt;
   View this page in French
&lt;/a&gt;</code></pre>

	<p>For people who use a screen reader to access content on the Internet, making use of this attribute will alert them to the fact that the language of the destination page is written in French. </p>

	<h2>Identify errors on a page</h2>
	<blockquote class="levelA">
		<p>3.3.1 Error Identification: If an input error is automatically detected, the item that is in error is identified and the error is described to the user in text.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>Many people who use the Internet are not able to perceive visual identifiers such as size, colour and shape.  As such if form errors rely on one or more of these identifiers alone, people with blindness or other severe visual impairments may find it hard to identify them.  When form errors are found they should be identified in text so that people who are blind or have severe visual impairments are able to identify them and rectify the errors.  This does not mean that visual identifiers cannot be used.  However, purely visual identifiers should not be the only means of identifying errors occurring on a form.</p>
	<p>It is good practice to include a list of all the errors encountered at the start of the form. Error messages in text should also be indicated next to each form field which contains an error. Clearly identifying where errors have occurred will help people correct their mistakes as they will be able to understand how many errors have occurred and where they have occurred. Understanding where errors have occurred will help everyone correct their mistakes with ease.</p>

	<h2 id="labelling-controls">Labelling form controls</h2>
	<blockquote class="levelA">
		<p>3.3.2 Labels or instructions: Labels or instructions are provided when content requires user input.</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>Providing relevant information and advice about online forms and how to use them can make the process of filling in forms significantly easier for the majority of visitors.  The provision of instructions for forms should be evaluated on a per-form basis.  For example, a simple search form should not require detailed instructions in order for people to use it.  It would generally suffice to ensure that there is a relationship in the code of the page between the search field and its label.  Supplementary information can be provided by ensuring the forms submit button accurately describes the action that will take place when the form is submitted.  For a simple search form the following code should achieve this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form action="/search/" method="POST"&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;label for="q"&gt;search&lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;input id="q" type="search" name="search" placeholder="Key words..."&gt;
    &lt;input type="submit" value="Search"&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;</code></pre>

	<p>Where more complex forms are used, further instructions should be provided to help people enter information easily.  There are a number of different techniques that can be used to provide this information.</p>

	<h3>Fieldset and legend elements</h3>
	<p>The <code>&lt;fieldset&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;legend&gt;</code> elements should be used to provide information about forms in their entirety, or about different sections of the same form.  The fieldset element should be used to group related fields together.  The <code>&lt;legend&gt;</code> element is designed to complement the <code>&lt;fieldset&gt;</code> element and should be used to provide a description of the field grouping defined by the <code>&lt;fieldset&gt;</code> element. </p>

<pre><code>&lt;form action=""&gt;
  &lt;fieldset&gt;
    &lt;legend&gt;Sign up&lt;/legend&gt;
      &lt;label for="uname"&gt;Enter a username&lt;/label&gt;
      &lt;input id="uname" type="text" name="uname"&gt;
      &lt;label for="pword"&gt;Enter a password&lt;/label&gt;
      &lt;input id="pword" type="password" name="pword"&gt;
      &lt;label for="fname"&gt;Your first name&lt;/label&gt;
      &lt;input id="fname" type="text" name="fname"&gt;
      &lt;label for="lname"&gt;Your last name&lt;/label&gt;
      &lt;input id="lname" type="text" name="lname"&gt;
      &lt;label for="email"&gt;Your email address&lt;/label&gt;
      &lt;input id="email" type="text" name="email"&gt;
    &lt;input type="submit" name="submit" value="Log in"&gt;
  &lt;/fieldset&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;</code></pre>

	<p>By default the fieldset element will appear with a thin black line around it.  This makes it easier for people to visually identify distinct sections of each form.  The legend element will display the text within it much as a label would.  This is certainly useful for sighted people but has benefits for people who use assistive technologies such as screen readers as well.</p>
	<p> Although support for the fieldset and legend elements varies from one screen reader package to the next, it is worthwhile including them in pages as they provide additional information about the relationships between fields in the form. When a person using a screen reader moves keyboard focus to a form field, many screen reader packages will look to see if the form field is nested within a fieldset element. If it is, it will look for the corresponding legend element and read it out before reading out the form label of the field. For example, if the "First name" field in the code example above were to receive keyboard focus many screen readers would read out "Sign up, Your first name".  This helps people to orientate themselves within the form and can greatly improve and streamline the form filling in process.</p>
	<p>It is worth noting that some screen reader packages will read this out every time a form field gains focus.  If too many fieldset elements are nested within one another, the resulting information can be quite frustrating for people who use screen readers.  As such, it is good practice to nest fieldset elements only as deep as is necessary or reasonable.  In addition to this, wherever the legend element is used it should be kept as short and concise as possible.  This will ensure that people who use screen readers will not be forced to listen to long strings of text each time they move keyboard focus to a new field.</p>

	<h3>The label element</h3>
	<p>The label element should be used in conjunction with form fields such as <code>&lt;input&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;textarea&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> elements.  The label element has a number of accessibility benefits built into it that, if used correctly, can provide significant improvements for people with and without disabilities.  For example, the label element can be associated with a form field by using specific attributes in the code of the page. This binding between a form field and a label makes it possible for screen reader software to identify the corresponding label whenever a form field gains focus and announces it to the person using the form.  This significantly improves the form filling process for people who use screen readers as it make it easy for people to understand what type of information to enter into each form field.</p>
	<p>In addition to this, a correctly associated form label acts as an extended hit area.  If a label is clicked focus will be moved to the corresponding form field automatically.  For people with poor motor control (such as people with Parkinson's disease) this has significant benefits.  To bind a form label and field together, the field must be given a unique "id" attribute.  This id can then be referenced by the label element using the "for" attribute.</p>
	<p>It is worth mentioning that the position of form labels in relation to their fields also has an impact on accessibility.  For the majority of form fields the label should appear immediately before the field.  However, for checkboxes and radio buttons the form label should wrap the field itself and the text appearing immediately after the form field.</p>
	<p>Normal (most) form fields:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;label for="q"&gt;Search&lt;/label&gt;
&lt;input id="q" type="text"/&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Checkboxes and radio fields:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;label for="confirm"&gt;
  &lt;input id="confirm" type="checkbox" name="conf"/&gt;
  I have read and agree to abide by the terms and conditions of this site.
&lt;/label&gt;</code></pre>

	<h3>Providing expected data format and example</h3>
	<p>If a form field requires data to be entered in a specific format, information about the format and an example should be provided as part of the label text.  This will make it easier for people to identify how the data should be entered and will help to reduce errors in the form submission.  For example, if a form field expects a date to be entered in a specific format people should be made aware of the format and an example should be provided.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;label for="date"&gt;
    Your date of birth in the format dd/mm/yyyy (e.g. 01/02/2003)
&lt;/label&gt;
&lt;input id="date" type="text"/&gt;</code></pre>

	<blockquote class="levelAA">
		<p>3.3.3 Error Suggestion: If an input error is automatically detected and suggestions for correction are known, then the suggestions are provided to the user, unless it would jeopardize the security or purpose of the content.</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>If errors are detected when a form is submitted, these errors should be identified and corrections suggested where possible.  For example, if a form field expects the name of a month to be entered but the month in numeric format had been entered instead, either of the following errors would be appropriate:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>"Please select from one of the following values: 'January', 'February', 'March', 'April', 'May', etc"</li>
		<li>"You entered '12' for the field 'Month'.  Did you mean 'December'?"</li>
	</ul>
	<p>This will help people to not only identify the error that they have made, but will also provide guidance on how to resolve the error.</p>
	<p>If a form field requires data to be entered in a specific format, but there is no finite number of options, information about the expected format should be provided.  For example, if a person submitted an email address in an incorrect format the resulting error might read "Please enter your email address in the format 'john.doe@domain.com'".  This will help people to identify the expected format and correct the error with greater ease.</p>

	<h2>Prevention of errors within a form</h2>
	<blockquote class="levelAA">
		<p>3.3.4 Error Prevention (Legal, Financial, Data): For Web pages that cause legal commitments or financial transactions for the user to occur, that modify or delete user-controllable data in data storage systems, or that submit user test responses, at least one of the following is true: reversible, checked, confirmed.</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>When entering sensitive information into a form such as entering your credit card details or personal information, the website should allow people to modify their information after it has been submitted in case mistakes were made. People with disabilities may be more likely to make mistakes when completing online forms.  For example, a person with a learning disability may enter letters or numbers into forms incorrectly.  For non reversible transactions this is likely to have serious consequences, particularly if submitting the form has monetary or legal implications.</p>
	<p>If any of the forms on the website are intended for a purpose that has a monetary or legal implication, people should be given the opportunity to review their submission and amend any errors in the data before finally submitting the form.  For example, most online stores will ask people to review all of their payment information in a summarised format before submitting the form and processing the payment.  Many stores go one step further, requiring people to select a checkbox on the page confirming that they have reviewed their order and that all information is correct before submitting the form.  This ensures that people are given every opportunity to review information before committing to a financially or legally binding contract.</p>
	<p>If any of the forms on the website cause legally binding transactions people should be given the opportunity to amend any of the information they have provided before submission.  In addition to this it is worthwhile providing a checkbox to ensure that the person has reviewed their submitted information and it is all correct.  This checkbox should be required in order for the form to be processed.</p>

	<p>When writing HTML and CSS code, the HTML validator and CSS validator are invaluable tools. Web page templates should be checked with both tools to ensure the markup is written correctly according to the rules of the language used. It is essential to run the templates through the validator and correct any mistakes found before integration into a content management system occurs. The earlier you can find and correct mistakes the easier they are to fix.</p>
	<p>As you make changes to the code it is important to revalidate the HTML and CSS to ensure mistakes haven't crept in. This is especially important when working in large teams, as one mistake in the HTML can have an impact on the rendering of CSS and JavaScript files on the site.</p>
