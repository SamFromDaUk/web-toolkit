	<h1>Multimedia</h1>

	<p>When you include multimedia content on the website you'll want to make sure everyone can enjoy it. This page explains how to make audio and video content accessible.</p>
	<p>The following WCAG 2.0 success criteria should be considered when developing multimedia content for Sky's website.</p>

	<h2 id="transcripts">Providing transcripts</h2>
	<blockquote class="levelA">
		<p>1.2.1 Audio-only and Video-only: For pre-recorded audio-only and pre-recorded video-only media, a textual alternative of the content is provided.  This will ensure that people who are unable to perceive the content of the media in one form are able to access it in other ways.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>Whether content is pure audio, video only, or combined audio video multimedia, you'll need to provide a transcript. A transcript is a text based document that contains the spoken dialogue, sound effects, and descriptions of the action taking place.  Deaf and hearing impaired people will benefit from reading the spoken dialogue and descriptions of sound effects. People who are blind or partially sighted will also benefit if the transcript includes descriptions of important visual activity.  You should place a link to the transcript immediately before the place where the multimedia content is displayed on the page. This ensures that people can find it easily before they reach the multimedia content itself.</p>

	<h3>How are transcripts created?</h3>
	<p>Transcripts should include different types of information, depending on the contents of the original file. Let's assume you're creating a transcript for a piece of audio and video multimedia content.</p>

	<h4>Step 1: Spoken dialogue</h4>
	<p>The first step is to include all the spoken dialogue for deaf and hearing impaired people to read. You start with the character's name, followed by the things they say.</p>
	<div class="goodexample">
		<ol class="dialogue">
			<li><span>Alice:</span> <q>The weather is dreadful this morning isn't it?</q></li>
			<li><span>Bob:</span> <q>It is indeed. Nice weather for ducks though!</q></li>
			<li><span>Alice:</span> <q>I'll put the kettle on.</q></li>
		</ol>
	</div>

	<h4>Step 2: Visual descriptions</h4>
	<p>The next step is to include some short descriptions of the scene itself. This is to help blind or partially sighted people discover where the scene takes place.</p>

	<div class="goodexample">
		<p>Bob stands by a window, looking out at the rain. Alice is nearby, but just out of sight.</p>
		<ol class="dialogue">
			<li><span>Alice:</span> <q>The weather is dreadful this morning isn't it?</q></li>
			<li><span>Bob:</span> <q>It is indeed. Nice weather for ducks though!</q></li>
			<li><span>Alice:</span> <q>I'll put the kettle on.</q></li>
		</ol>
	</div>

	<h4>Step 3: Sound effects</h4>
	<p>The last step is to include descriptions of any key sound effects. In this example you don't need to mention the rain because it can be clearly heard and seen, but there may be other important noises you need to include.</p>
	<div class="goodexample">
		<p>Bob stands by a window, looking out at the rain. Alice is nearby, but just out of sight.</p>
		<ol class="dialogue">
			<li><span>Alice:</span> <q>The weather is dreadful this morning isn't it?</q></li>
			<li><span>Bob:</span> <q>It is indeed. Nice weather for ducks though!</q></li>
			<li><span>Alice:</span> <q>I'll put the kettle on.</q></li>
		</ol>
		<p>An enormous clap of thunder makes Bob jump away from the window.</p>
	</div>

	<h2>Providing captions</h2>
	<blockquote class="levelA">
	<p>1.2.2 Captions: Captions are provided for all pre-recorded audio content in synchronized media, except when the media is a media alternative for text and is clearly labelled as such.</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>For people with severe hearing impairments or deafness, audio tracks (both within movie files and pure audio) will not be perceivable to them.  As such, a visible captions track should be provided for them.  Captions not only include dialogue, but also include information about who is speaking and identify important information conveyed through sound that is not visible on screen.  Providing captions will ensure that people with deafness will be able to access all of the content within synchronized media such as movies and audio broadcasts.</p>
	<p>There are two types of caption tracks that are often found in use on the Internet. </p>
	<ol>
	<li>Open captions are generally embedded into the media itself and are constantly displayed on screen.  This represents the most basic method for providing captions and is sufficient to pass this success criterion.  However, this is likely to irritate people who do not require visible captions as they will be unable to turn them off.</li>
	<li>Closed captions are like open captions but are not embedded into the video.  This means that they can be turned on or off by activating a button or link within the media player interface.  This will ensure that people who need captions are able to use them, whilst those that do not require them can turn them off if required.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Captions should flow in a logical order that accurately conveys the meaning presented in audio tracks at any given time.  If captions are accurately synchronised with video in this way the resultant meaning should be coherent and easily understandable.</p>
	<h4>Example</h4>
	<p>If we were creating captions for a period drama we would include the following text:</p>
	<div class="goodexample">
		<p>A horse and cart can be heard approaching on the gravel driveway.  Elizabeth can be heard running down the stairs.</p>
		<p>Elizabeth: Mother, He's here, He's here...</p>
		<p>Elizabeth's Mother:  (from the back of the house) Already?  I thought he was not due until tomorrow evening.</p>
	</div>
	<p>There are many different technologies that can be used to provide closed or open captions.  The one that you choose to use will depend largely on the technology that you are using to present the synchronised media. </p>
	<p>If possible, it is worthwhile providing closed captions as opposed to open captions.  This will allow people to choose whether or not to show or hide them.</p>

	<h2>Providing a media alternative</h2>
	<blockquote class="levelA">
		<p>1.2.3 Audio Description or Media Alternative:  An alternative for time-based media or audio description of the pre-recorded video content is provided for synchronized media except when the media is a media alternative for text and is clearly labelled as such.</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>For people with blindness or severe visual impairments visual content is not likely to be easily perceivable for them. As such, synchronised media such as video content poses a potential accessibility issue for people with severe visual impairments and blindness.</p>
	<p>There are a couple of different ways that this issue can be dealt with:  </p>
	<ol>
	<li>The first option is to provide an audio description of the visual content within the movie.  For more information on this point please refer to <a href="multimedia.html#audio-desc">Audio Description</a> below.</li>
	<li>The other option is to provide another media alternative such as a transcript presented in pure text.  Since plain text is a baseline technology that almost everyone can access in one form or another, a plain text transcript should theoretically be accessible to everyone.  For more information on transcripts and how to provide them please refer to <a href="multimedia.html#transcripts">transcripts</a> above.</li>
	</ol>

	<p>By providing a media alternative in plain text or by providing an audio description track you will ensure that people with blindness or severe visual impairments are able to access and understand content that would otherwise rely on visual perception to be understood. </p>
	<p>It is worthwhile mentioning that for level A accessibility only one of these methods needs to be provided.  However, in order to achieve level AA accessibility, both an audio description track and a text alternative will need to be provided.</p>

	<h2>Captioning for live content</h2>
	<blockquote class="levelAA">
		<p>1.2.4 Captions (live): Captions are provided for all live audio content in synchronized media</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>The issues and solutions identified in the "Captions" section above apply to live synchronised media as well as pre-recorded media.  For example, a live video conference on the Internet would require captions for people who are unable to hear or are browsing using a device that does not support audio content.  It is likely that these captions would need to be transcribed in real time and as such this can be tricky to implement.  However, this is a requirement to pass level AA accessibility and, as such, should be taken into consideration if live broadcasts are made.  If it is not possible to create captions in real time it is worthwhile considering pre-recording the content or presentation and presenting it at a later date complete with captions.  For more information on this point please refer to the "Captions" section above.</p>

	<h2 id="audio-desc">Providing an audio description</h2>
	<blockquote class="levelAA">
		<p>1.2.5 Audio Description: Audio description is provided for all pre-recorded video content in synchronized media.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>For people with blindness or severe visual impairments visual content is not likely to be easily perceivable for them.  As such, synchronised media such as video content poses a potential accessibility issue for people with severe visual impairments and blindness.</p>
	<p>One of the methods used to provide information about content that relies on visual perception is to provide an audio description of the video content.  An audio description is a selectable track that is intended to describe content or actions that cannot be perceived by people with blindness or severe visual impairments. </p>

	<p>The Sky Accessibility site (for Sky customers with disabilities) has a <a href="http://accessibility.sky.com/sky-tv-help/audio-description">good example of audio description</a>.</p>

	<p>An audio description should augment any existing audible content as opposed to replacing it.  It should provide information about actions, characters and scene changes in existing pauses in the movies dialogue. </p>
	<p>For example, if audio description were being used to describe a game of poker, it could be used to identify peoples' actions, reactions and information about any people joining or leaving the game.  Audio description does not attempt to provide information about actions or events that are already adequately identifiable through the audio part of the track.</p>

	<h2 id="volume-control">Volume control for audio</h2>
	<blockquote class="levelA">
		<p>1.4.2 Audio Control: If any audio on a Web page plays automatically for more than 3 seconds, either a mechanism is available to pause or stop the audio, or a mechanism is available to control audio volume independently from the overall system volume level.</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>For people who use assistive technologies such as screen reading software, sound that plays on a webpage can inhibit their ability to navigate the page effectively.  Screen reading software relays content on the Internet to the person using the software by means of a synthesised audible 'voice'.  Audible content on the Internet can therefore pollute the same audible space used by the screen reader software.  Since most screen reader packages are now software based this situation is exacerbated since the computers master volume will affect the volume of both the web based content and the screen reader itself.  As such, individual volume controls should be provided for all audible content on a web page.  It must be possible for people to completely disable the sound for audio content on a web page (either by reducing the sound level to 0 or by activating a 'mute' control).</p>
	<p>It is worth mentioning that if sound plays automatically on a web page, people who use screen reading software are likely to find it hard to identify the controls for turning off the audible content.  As such it is important that if an audio track plays automatically it plays for no longer than 3 seconds in total.  If an audio track is longer than three seconds in length, it is best to ensure that it does not play automatically.  Instead, it should only be started when activated by the person using the page.</p>

	<h2 id="pause-button">Ensure media can be paused</h2>
	<blockquote class="levelA">
	<p>2.2.1 Timing Adjustable: For each time limit that is set by the content, at least one of the following is true: turn off, adjust, extend, real-time exception, essential exception, 20 hour exception.</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>Lots of video and synchronised media on the Internet contains textual content.  If you consider the requirement for captioning when it comes to video and audio content on the Internet this is even more likely to be the case.  This is great for people with deafness or other severe visual impairments.  However, if it is not possible to pause or extend the rate at which text on the screen is updated people with severe learning difficulties and visual impairments are likely to find it difficult if not impossible to read the text comfortably.</p>
	<p>For this reason it is important that people are able to pause and restart content from where it was last stopped.  This will make it possible for people to intermittently stop and start automatically updating content in such a way that they will have sufficient time to read text at a rate that is comfortable for them.</p>
	<p>In terms of best practise it is also important to note that content should not play by default.  If content can play, scroll or update periodically it should only do so if it has first been requested by the user.  For example, a video on a web page should not start playing as soon as the page is loaded.  Instead it should only start to play when someone activates the play button associated with the movie.  It is also worthwhile noting that the controls for interacting with video content should be keyboard accessible.  This will ensure that people who are unable to use a mouse will still be able to interact with synchronised media on the Internet effectively.</p>


	<h2>Avoid flashing content</h2>
	<blockquote class="levelA">
	<p>2.3.1 Three Flashes or Below Threshold: Web pages do not contain anything that flashes more than three times in any one second period, or the flash is below the general flash and red flash thresholds.</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>People should be able to access all the content on a page without inducing seizures due to photosensitivity. Seizures can be triggered in some people by content which flashes at certain frequencies.</p>
	<p>If you have flashing content on the website such as video or animated sequences, make sure it is kept to a minimum and does not flash for more than a few seconds. Some people are more sensitive to red flashing than to other colours, so keep this in mind when adding this type of content.</p>
	<p>If you do have flashing content you should ensure that the content does not flash more than three times in any 1 second period or the flashing area of content is small enough so it does not cause seizures for people with photosensitivity.</p>

	<h2>Final thoughts</h2>
	<p>A great way of communicating with your target audience is to use audio and video content to get your message across. The use of audio and video content online has sky rocketed in the last couple of years as it is now very easy to create this type of content. If you do decide to add multimedia content you will need to make sure you also provide alternatives for people who may not be able to see the video or those who can not hear the audio.  Ensuring that equivalent alternatives for multimedia content are provided will allow everyone to access the content and spread your message further.</p>
