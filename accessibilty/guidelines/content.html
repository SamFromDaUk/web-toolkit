	<h1>Content - guidelines</h1>
	<p>Creating and maintaining content is a key component of a successful website and sustaining your accessibility goals. This page explains how to produce accessible web content that will be clear and easy to read.</p>
	<p>The following WCAG 2.0 success criteria should be considered when creating web content for Sky.</p>


	<h2 id="alt-text">Alternative text for images</h2>
	<blockquote class="levelA">
	<p>1.1.1 Non-Text Content:  All non-text content that is presented to the user has a text alternative that serves the equivalent purpose</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>Using images as part of web content is essential for creating a visually engaging page. Images help to break up the flow of text and draw people into the page by making it more visually appealing.</p>
	<p>Not everyone can see images on a web page. People using screen readers or Braille devices may not be able to physically see an image, but they can access textual information about the image instead. You should provide a text description for each image added. The description must convey the same information as the image so if the image contains the words "Final Sale - 50% off all our package holidays" the text description should contain the same words.</p>
	<p>Most content management systems allow to you add alternative text to an image easily. Depending on the content management system you have chosen, you may either have to add a text description for the image when you first upload the image to the system, or add the description when you add the image to the page. You should have a specific field in the content management system for adding this description to each image.</p>

	<figure>
		<img src="../assets/images/content-01.png" alt="The image details screen in the Defacto Content Management System, where you can add a title, alternative text description and a further description for each image.">
		<figcaption>Figure 1: Adding an alternative text description to an image in Defacto CMS.</figcaption>
	</figure>

	<p>There is a limit of 240 characters on the amount of information you can provide for text description. However, there may be cases where you need to provide more information about an image than is possible in a short description. You may need to describe the processes in a flow chart or diagram or you might have an illustration which shows how a car engine works. Either way you cannot provide equivalent alternative information with 240 characters. You need to take a different approach with this type of content. You can either:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Place a long description of the image in text next to the image itself, or</li>
	<li>Provide a link near to the image to a page containing the long description.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<figure>
		<img src="../assets/images/content-02.png" alt="A page showing a complex diagram for 'applying from a crown court'. Below the diagram and in the content are links allowing people to read a full description of the diagram in text.">
		<figcaption>Figure 2: Links to a full text description of the diagram are provided below the diagram itself and also in the content of the page.</figcaption>
	</figure>

	<p>In some cases, you may want to add images to a page to improve the visual appearance of the page rather than those which convey information. If the image doesn't convey information or doesn't help add to the reputation of the organisation then you may want to consider leaving the text description for the image empty. If the description is left empty then the presence of the image is not announced to people using assistive technologies. This effectively means you are allowing people using assistive technologies to skip over the image in the same way a sighted person might visually skip over the image.</p>
	<p>If you are unsure whether you image needs a description or not, the best option is to always provide a description. In this way, someone using a screen reader or Braille device can decide for themselves if the content in the image is relevant to them.</p>

	<p>Not using alt-text would apply to images on the homepage  above news stories, which (in early 2013) are just duplicates of the link text:</p>

	<figure>
		<img class="bordered" src="../assets/images/content-15.png" alt="A screenshot of a page showing four decorative images in the content area of the page. The images should have 'null' alternative text descriptions as they do not convey any important information.">
		<figcaption>Figure 3: Images which do not convey any important information or repeat nearby text should have 'null' alternative text descriptions.</figcaption>
	</figure>

	<p>Null text means the attribute is there, but blank:</p>
	<pre><code>&lt;img src="image.jpg" <strong>alt=""</strong>&gt;</code></pre>

	<h2>Multimedia content</h2>
	<blockquote class="levelA">
	<p>1.2.2 Captions: Captions are provided for all pre-recorded audio content in synchronized media, except when the media is a media alternative for text and is clearly labelled as such.</p>
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote class="levelA">
	<p>1.2.3 Audio Description or Media Alternative:  An alternative for time-based media or audio description of the pre-recorded video content is provided for synchronized media except when the media is a media alternative for text and is clearly labelled as such.</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>For any multimedia content you provide on the website you should consider that some people may not be able to access it due to software or hardware limitations or a disability. Some people may not be able to perceive video or audible information, may not have the correct Flash version installed or have JavaScript available in their browsers. Just because someone cannot access the information doesn't mean they shouldn't know what the information is about. For example a visually impaired person might want to know what is in a video presentation even if they can't see it. Equally sighted people might want to know what the content of a video or audio file is before they download it. With this in mind, when you add multimedia to any web pages you should also add a short summary or title for the multimedia content as near to the video or audio content as possible. Ideally the title and summary should be above the multi-media content as it will then describe the subsequent content below.</p>

	<h2>Conforming to Web Standards</h2>
	<blockquote class="levelA">
	<p>1.3.1 Information and Relationships: Information, structure, and relationships conveyed through presentation can be programmatically determined or are available in text.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>Using the correct HTML code to represent elements on a page provides information to assistive technologies such as screen readers. For example, a key press in JAWs will take you straight to the next heading - if it is marked as a heading in the code.</p>

	<h3>Headings</h3>
	<p>Headings are an important element, and are covered below in <a href="content.html#descriptive-headings">Write descriptive headings</a>.</p>

	<h3>Lists</h3>
	<p>Lists are an excellent way to break up text and help to keep people interested in the content. Lists make content clearer, easier to scan and easier for readers to identify important information. However, too many lists can disrupt the flow of content on a page. Lists should only be used to group two or more items of similar content.</p>
	<p>There are three different types of lists you can use on a web page. They are bulleted, ordered and paired lists. The content management system may not allow you to use all of these options, however it is useful to know about them.</p>
	<h4>Bulleted Lists</h4>
	<p>Bulleted lists are the most common type of lists used on web pages and the type of list you will probably use more often. You should use this type of list for content which does not have a specific order, for example a list of books:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Hound of the Baskervilles</li>
		<li>Treasure  Island</li>
		<li>The Picture of Dorian Gray</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Ordered Lists</h4>
	<p>If you are adding a list to a page which has a specific order you should use an ordered list. Ordered lists can be preceded with numbers, letters or roman numerals.</p>

	<ol>
	<li>Fill out the registration form</li>
	<li>Check your email</li>
	<li>Activate your account</li>
	</ol>

	<h4>Paired Lists</h4>
	<p>Paired lists consist of pairs of related content. Paired lists are also known as definition lists and are less frequently used on web pages than bulleted and ordered lists:</p>
	<dl>
		<dt>Cat:</dt>
		<dd>A feline mammal with thick soft fur and no ability to roar!</dd>
	</dl>

	<p>The content management system may not include an option for paired lists. If it doesn't don't worry, you can use a bulleted list instead. While this isn't as good as a paired list because it doesn't explicitly convey the relationship between the two items of content, it should be a sufficient fallback option.</p>
	<ul>
	<li><strong>Cat:</strong> A feline mammal with thick soft fur and no ability to roar!</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Paragraphs</h3>
	<p>It's important to use paragraphs when writing web copy as too much text in one block can be difficult to read online. Short, succinct paragraphs of roughly 60 words will make it easier for many people to read and enjoy the content on each pages. You should front load paragraphs by putting key points at the start of them.</p>
	
	<figure>
		<img class="bordered" src="../assets/images/content-05.png" alt="Content on a page is split into paragraphs.">
		<figcaption>Figure 5: Paragraphs (highlighted) are used to make the content on the page easier to read.</figcaption>
	</figure>

	<h3>Tables</h3>
	<p>If you need to add tables of data you should also be able to do this through the content management system. Tables should only be used for displaying data and should not be used to create different ways of laying out page content. (A data table is where the headings have a relationship with the data-cells.)</p>
	<p>When tables are used they should be kept simple. Depending on the design of the table, all tables must have either column or row headings. This is an extremely important point to keep in mind. People using assistive technologies use table headings to help understand the relationships between rows and columns in the table.</p>
	<p>In the content management system you should have options for inserting tables. You may even have the option to choose to use table headings or not. You should always choose to use table headings. If table headings are missing, then it can make it difficult for people using assistive technologies to understand the content in the table.</p>

		<img class="bordered" src="../assets/images/content-06.png" alt="A 'create table' dialog box showing the 'create headings' option highlighted.">
		<figcaption>Figure 6: Inserting tables using a content management system.</figcaption>
	</figure>

	<h3>Quotations</h3>
	<p>From time to time you may need to add quotations to web copy. You might be including testimonials from clients or customers or including a quote from someone in Sky. You should have a quotations option in the content management system which will allow you to add quotations to web pages.</p>

	<figure>
		<img class="bordered" src="../assets/images/content-07.png" alt="A sample content page showing quotations.">
		<figcaption>Figure 7: Quotations including on a page.</figcaption>
	</figure>

	<p>Some content management systems do not include this feature. If you want to add quotations make sure you take this into consideration when procuring a content management system. Please see the <a href="../overviews/procurement.html">procurement overview</a> for more information.</p>
	<h3>Emphasising text</h3>
	<p>You may want to emphasize small portions of text to make it stand out. Most content management systems allow you to use bold and italicised text to highlight important sections.</p>
	<p>Emphasised words help people find what they need from the content by getting the key points across to the audience quicker. You should be careful not to use too much as it can have the opposite effect making text harder to scan and read. When emphasising text think about:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Who the audience is;</li>
	<li>What the audience wants from the page;</li>
	<li>What you want them to focus on.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Make sure you emphasise the right things and only emphasize one or two words or phrases at most per paragraph.</p>

		<img src="../assets/images/content-08.png" alt="The Barclays website uses bold styling to highlight important words in their content.">
		<figcaption>Figure 8: Using bold to highlight important words.</figcaption>
	</figure>

	<h3>Abbreviations</h3>
	<p>At some point you may need to include abbreviations within web copy. It is important to ensure that where abbreviations are used they are written out in full the first time they occur in the content. Some abbreviations may be more obvious than others, but you should appreciate that not everyone may understand the abbreviation. You should also consider that some abbreviations may have different meanings in different contexts. Take the following abbreviations as an example:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>ROI - Return on Investment or Republic of Ireland</li>
		<li>PID - Project Initiation Documentation or Pelvic Inflammatory Disease</li>
		<li>BTP - Business Transaction Performance or British Transport Police</li>
	</ul>
	<p>To include an abbreviation in copy you can either write out the abbreviation followed by the full meaning in brackets or visa versa.</p>
	<ul>
	<li>ROI (Return on Investment)</li>
	<li>Return on Investment (ROI)</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Don't rely on shape, size or visual location</h2>
	<blockquote class="levelA">
	<p>1.3.3 Sensory Characteristics: Instructions provided for understanding and operating content do not rely solely on sensory characteristics of components such as shape, size, visual location, orientation, or sound.</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>The occurrence of information identified by sensory characteristics such as shape, size, visual location or orientation is more common than you might imagine on the web. You have probably come across copy such as 'use the menu on the left' or 'click the map on the right' more than once. While these instructions may make sense to sighted people, those with visual impairments may struggle to interpret them.</p>

	<figure>
		<img src="../assets/images/content-09.png" alt="The help page of the Easyjet website. Text at the top of the page reads 'Search for a keyword or phrase above or browse through popular topics below'. The search for a keyword form is below this text rather than above it.">
		<figcaption>Figure 9: The content conveys information based on visual location.</figcaption>
	</figure>

	<p>You may have also come across websites which use icons or graphics to represent navigation items or provide additional information about a subject. Some people may not be able to interpret the true meaning of icons and graphics, while other people may not have access to information conveyed in this manner at all (see the Adding Images section below). To help everyone understand the purpose and meaning of icons or graphics you should provide a text label as an accompaniment.</p>

	<h2>Avoid the use of colour alone</h2>
	<blockquote class="levelA">
		<p>1.4.1 Use of Colour: Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information, indicating an action, prompting a response, or distinguishing a visual element.</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>In the same way some people cannot perceive shape, size or visual location, some people cannot perceive colour at all. Other people such as those who are older or have sight deficiencies may not be able to see colour well. People with partial sight may have limited colour vision.</p>
	<p>Web content should not rely on colour alone to convey information, but instead use colour to enhance access to information. Colour should be used with a text description to communicate your message. For example do not write 'select the green button', instead write 'select the green Next button'.</p>

	<figure>
		<img class="smaller" src="../assets/images/content-11.png" alt="Content reads 'Click the large green sign up button to register now!' A large green 'sign up' button is provided below this content.">

	<h2>Using sufficient colour contrast</h2>
	<blockquote class="levelAA">
	<p>1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum): The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for the following large text, incidental, logotypes.</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>If you are commissioning images or graphics for the website which contain text you must make sure the foreground and background colours used have sufficient contrast. People with low vision may have difficulty reading text that does not contrast with its background.</p>
	<p>The best approach is to test the colours used at the earliest possible stage. The colour contrast analyser is an excellent tool which allows you to test combinations of foreground and background colours. Using its eye dropper tool you can quickly and easily test the foreground and background colours used in images. You will need to ensure that the chosen colours have a sufficient contrast ratio. However, this is not as simple as it sounds as the size of the text also plays a part. As larger text is often easier to read at lower contrast the contrast requirement for larger text is lower than smaller text sizes.</p>
	<p>You will need ratios of:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>3:1 for larger text (at least 18pt in size or 14pt if bold)</li>
	<li>4.5:1 for smaller text (less than 18pt in size or 14pt if bold)</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Using text within an image</h2>
	<blockquote class="levelAA">
	<p>1.4.5 Images of Text: If the technologies being used can achieve the visual presentation, text is used to convey information rather than images of text, except for the following customizable, essential.</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>As we have seen, people access content on the web in different ways and have different requirements for viewing content. People who wear glasses or those with low vision often adjust the text size, fonts or colours on a website to enable them to read the content more easily.</p>
	<p>When commissioning images which contain text, you should keep in mind that people who need to make adjustments to text will not be able to adjust the text in the images. This means you should only consider using images of text where absolutely necessary. You may need to consult the web development team to see if the information you are trying to convey as an image might be more appropriate translated into code (HTML/CSS).</p>
	<p>If you do decide to use images of text then you should make sure that any text in the image is suitably large. By large we mean a minimum of 16pts in size. This size should allow the majority of people to read the text in the image sufficiently well.  It is also worth noting that text in images is subject to the same colour contrast requirements as HTML text.  For more information on this point please refer to the "using sufficient colour contrast" section above.</p>

		<img class="smaller" src="../assets/images/content-13.png" alt="Two images containing the text 'grab a bargain 50% off all items'. One image shows the text at 16pts in size, the other shows the text in the image at 10pts in size.">

	<h2 id="page-titles">Creating page titles</h2>
	<blockquote  class="levelA">
	<p>2.4.2 Page Titled: Web pages have titles that describe topic or purpose.</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>The title is one of the most important parts of a page. The page title should be unique within the website and clearly describe the topic or purpose of the page. The page title helps people understand if the content on the page is relevant to them. Page titles can also help people identify the section of the website hierarchy in which the current page exists.</p>
	<p>The page title usually consists of three parts, the name of the page, the section of the website containing the page and the name of the website. It appears at the very top of the browser window and is one of the first things someone using assistive technology will encounter when they reach the page.</p>

	<figure>
		<img src="../assets/images/content-14.png" alt="A browser window showing the page title highlighted at the top of the browser and in the current tab.">
		<figcaption>Figure 14: Providing descriptive page titles.</figcaption>
	</figure>

	<p>As the page title is likely to contain a reasonable amount of content, it is best to put the most important information at the beginning of the page title. If people are visiting are interested in its content so putting the name of the page first is the best option. The name of the section containing the page should come next to help people understand where they are within the website hierarchy, followed by the name of the website. This order of content works best because people do not have to listen or read through the whole page title before understanding if the content on the page is relevant to them. They can grab the meaningful information quickly and either read further down the page or leave the page to find more appropriate content.</p>
	<p>In most content management systems only part of the title can be controlled by content authors. The name of the page is usually the only part content authors can edit. The name of the section containing the page will be automatically generated depending on the location of the page in the site. The website name will be the same across each page in the site and will be added by the developers.</p>
	<p>You should make sure when adding and editing the name of the page that the name clearly describes the topic of the page and contains relevant keywords. For example if you were writing about the Tower of London and in particular the White  Tower, the name of the page should be 'The White Tower'. The full page title might be something like this:</p>
	<p><code>[Name of the page], [Section of the website] -  [Name of the website]</code></p>
	<p>For example:<br>
		The White Tower, The Tower of London - Historic Royal Palaces</p>

	<blockquote class="levelA">
	<p>2.4.4 Link Text: The purpose of each link can be determined from the link text alone, or from the link text together with its programmatically determined link context, except where the purpose of the link would be ambiguous to users in general.</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>You may want to add links to pages and documents to give people access to additional related information. When adding links it is important to make sure the phrase used for the link can be understood if the link is read in isolation. People using assistive technologies in particular those using screen readers very often jump from link to link using the 'tab' key to navigate more quickly through a set of pages. If the phrase used for the link doesn't make sense when read by itself, people will have to read the surrounding page content in order to decipher the link and understand where it might lead. This can be a frustrating experience for people who are unable to see the page.</p>
	<p>You should avoid using phrases for links such as:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Click here;</li>
		<li>More information;</li>
		<li>Read more.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Instead use phrases which have context and can be understood by everyone. Using clear and simple phrases for links will also help people with cognitive impairments as they can sometimes be confused if there are multiple means of navigation on a page.</p>
	<p>Several tips for writing good link phrases include:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Use the title of the page the link is leading to;</li>
	<li>Do not use entire sentences as links.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>When linking to documents use the name of the document as the link and provide the type and size of the document as part of the link text, for example "London Underground Map (PDF, 2MB)".</p>

	<h2 id="descriptive-headings">Write descriptive headings</h2>
	<blockquote class="levelAA">
		<p>2.4.6 Headings and Labels: Headings and labels describe topic or purpose.</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>Headings are particularly useful for people who use assistive technologies. Many assistive technologies have short cut keys which allow people to move between similar page elements. In screen readers such as JAWs, people can move between headings on a page. Cycling between headings is an excellent way of working out what information is available on the page. This makes it easier for people to scan and make sense of the page.</p>
	<p>When adding them to a page you need to make sure you use headings in the correct order.</p>

	<figure>
		<img src="../assets/images/content-16.png" alt="Screenshot from Sky's shop area showing multiple heading 1 elements." class="bordered">
		<figcaption>Firgure 15: Some pages include multiple <code>H1</code> elements, and skip <code>H2</code>s.</figcaption>
	</figure>

	<p>The content management system should have a pre-defined set of options for adding headings. If Sky has a set of style guidelines you may find the headings have the same name as in the style guide such as main heading or sub headings. Alternatively headings maybe referred to as heading 2, heading 3 etc. These options are not simply a choice of headings you can use anywhere. They should be used for a specific purpose and must descend in order.</p>
	<p>The page title should be the first heading on the page and should automatically be output as a heading by the content management system. In most content management systems, the title of the page is entered separately from the main body of content on the page. This means the first heading you use within your main content should be a main heading or heading 2. All headings within this section should then cascade sequentially down from there. Headings should only drop one level at a time, so after using a main heading or heading 2, you must use a sub-heading or heading 3 e.g.</p>
	<dl class="goodexample">
		<dt>Page Title (H1)</dt>
		<dd>Codebreakers: The Inside Story of Bletchley Park</dd>
		<dt>Main heading (H2)</dt>
		<dd>Introduction</dd>
		<dt>Main heading (h2)</dt>
		<dd>The Production of Ultra Intelligence</dd>
		<dt>Sub heading (h3)</dt>
		<dd>Life in and out</dd>
		<dt>Sub heading (H3)</dt>
		<dd>The Duty Officer</dd>
		<dt>Sub heading (H3)</dt>
		<dd>A Naval Officer</dd>
		<dt>Sub heading (H3)</dt>
		<dd>The Z Watch</dd>
	</dl>

	<h2>Human language of parts of the page</h2>
	<blockquote class="levelA">
	<p>3.1.2 Language of parts: The human language of each passage or phrase in the content can be programmatically determined except for proper names, technical terms, words of indeterminate language, and words or phrases that have become part of the vernacular of the immediately surrounding text.</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>Many websites contain content written in multiple languages (e.g. English, French etc). If you need to add content in a language other than English you need to make sure the content management system has the ability to do this correctly.</p>
	<p>The spoken language of a web page needs to be identified in the code of the page as this allows assistive technologies such as screen readers and Braille devices to switch to the relevant language, outputting the content with the correct pronunciation and accent. The information is then relayed to people using these devices in the correct format. Some people with cognitive, language and learning disabilities who use text-to-speech software will also benefit from the language being identified correctly.</p>

	<h2>Identify content consistently</h2>
	<blockquote class="levelAA">
	<p>3.2.4 Consistent Identification: Components that have the same functionality within a set of Web pages are identified consistently.</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>People using screen readers and other types of assistive technology rely on components of web pages to be consistent. When using these types of technology many people depend on their familiarity with features on a website as a strategy to help navigate and operate the website. Consistency is the key to this strategy. If features of the website are labelled or referenced in a different manner on different web pages then it is far more difficult to use this strategy as a means of traversing a website. Inconsistencies of this type may also be confusing and increase the cognitive load for people with cognitive impairments.</p>
	<p>Take care to use a consistent set of words and phrases to reference features and components on the website. Consistency also extends to alternative text descriptions for images. Where the same image has been used on different web pages it should have the same text description. As mentioned previously, this may be something which is handled by the content management system when you first upload an image but it is worth being aware of.</p>

	<h2>Final thoughts</h2>
	<p>Your content is the most important part of the website. It provides people with the information about Sky's products and services. Making sure your content is inspiring and engaging as well as easy to understand will help people find what they are looking for and encourage them to return.</p>
